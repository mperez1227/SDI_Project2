<p>My story and is based on going out with my cousin, her husband and my boyfriend. We usually go out
to the movies and to a restaurant. We are all around the same age group so we have lots of fun when 
we get together. I chose this as my story, because it reminds me of the times we have gone out and it 
brings me joy and a lot of laughter.</p>
